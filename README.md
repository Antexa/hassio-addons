# Forked-DAAPD

Based on [johnpdowling's addon](https://github.com/johnpdowling/hassio-addons/tree/master/forked-daapd), with spotify, chromecast and airplay added.
The configuration tab isn't implemented yet, you will need to edit the config file in /share/forked-daapd/forked-daapd.conf if you want to change anything.
The defaults should work fine for most uses.
